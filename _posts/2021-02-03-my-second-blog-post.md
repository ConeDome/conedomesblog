A lot has happened recently, I've made a pinboard project, we've talked about starting to fly drones autonmously with code. It's been pretty fun. There were moments when I really thought I wasn't going to get stuff done. I'll probably cycle back to my blog in a little while to make it look good. During the blog post I was able learn how to add different fonts to my websites. It was kind of frustrating because I wasn't reading the directions, but I figured it out by myself and now I know i wont forget that. Also I learned how to make Card Containers which are little boxes where I can add stuff, like images words, and buttons.
