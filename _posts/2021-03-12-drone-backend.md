Wow this was a frustrating week, but on the LAST DAY, we finally got our command inout line working, it's called "Mover". Now all we have to do is define the commands to that'll work with it. I feel bad because there wasn't much for Austin to do until Nick and I got "Mover" done. Let's talk about the big failure we had tho, we creted a frontend for an html document in our JavaScript Backend so that was... frustrating but it'll be okay. All in all it was a good week.
