<h1>Failures Of The Past Week</h1>
It's been a rough past week, this week alone we've had <b>SO MANY</b> failures it's unbelievable. Throughout this entire process we've encountered countless errors, restarted our <b>entire code</b>, and had server issues. But after countless hours of debugging everything came together this week

<h1>Success At Long Last</h1>
Finally after restarting our code for the third time we were able to come up with an idea that seems to be working without many flaws.

Meet "Mover", he's my son and I love him. He allows me to control the drone by hand and in real time. This is quite easy to use actually, instead of precoding everything for a course I can manually change George's (our tello drone's name) route!

It doesnt matter that we practically ripped off the command line tool, what matter's is we are the best
