welp, this was an utter failure, we were unable to connect to our drone. We were able to ping the drone using the ip echo command, so at least we know that the drone is working. Mr. Bailey says we're going to have to debug this as a group to understand what's going on. One guy got his stuck in the ceiling not gunna lie it was pretty funny. That same person was able to connect to our drone and fly it, which makes me think that something is wrong with our computers. Either that or the UDP (the machine gun of information) is failing on all points which is confusing. Oh well it's time for trial and error.
